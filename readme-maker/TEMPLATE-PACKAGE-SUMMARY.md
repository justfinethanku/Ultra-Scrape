## Pattern Library from Ultra-Doc

### Structural Patterns Captured

1. **Hero Formula**
   - [What is X?] + [Problem Solved] + [Core Mechanism] + [Joke/Personality Moment]
   - Template implements this exactly

2. **Emoji Strategy**
   - Section headers: 🚀 launch, 📦 package, 🛠️ tools, 🚦 usage, 🧪 quality, 🔁 automation, 📊 metrics, 🤝 community
   - Feature bullets: Metaphorical emoji matching capability type
   - All documented in the guide

3. **Table Types**
   - Philosophy/Comparison tables (approach A vs B)
   - Decision-Tree tables (options + triggers)
   - Metrics/Economics tables (before/after/savings)
   - All included with instructions

4. **Multi-Path Onboarding**
   - Fresh install vs Migration scenarios
   - Conversational AI prompts for copy-paste
   - Platform-specific paths
   - Template has 3 installation methods built-in

5. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Simple → Complex structure
   - Primary command first, then options
   - Implemented in Usage section

### Voice Patterns Captured

1. **Confidence**: "solves the problem", "pays for itself"
2. **Parenthetical Humor**: "(It's a thing...)", "(You're welcome.)"
3. **Action-Oriented**: Copy-paste prompts, clear CTAs
4. **Evidence-Based**: Quantified benefits (92% savings)
5. **Conversational**: "Hey Claude", natural language

All documented in **Tone & Voice Guidelines** section.
